Though the number of board games sold rose over the course of the pandemic, games that were popular in 2020 tended to be popular in 2021. Versions of Gloomhaven, Pandemic, Brass, Terraforming and Twilight Imperium all appeared in the top five most popular games, according to a dataset from Board Game Geek. 

```{r}
#use this to do side by side comparison of board games ranked between 2020 and 2021
compare_20_21 <-
  bind_rows(board_games_20,board_games_21) 
compare_20_21 <- compare_20_21 %>% 
  select(key, Rank, data_year)%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = data_year, values_from = Rank)
```

What did people love about these games in 2020 and 2021? Based on comments by reviewers who left the top five games a score of 10, people seemed to favor strategic games that were cooperative rather than competitive in nature. Interesting storylines and replay value were also key components. In some cases, the game's artwork also contributed to a positive experience. People also seemed to like games that were relatively easy to pick up and could be played with kids or newcomers to the game.

Without a comparison point, it's hard to gauge if those factors influence game popularity generally, or if they were particularly important during the pandemic. Future analysis could attempt to answer whether cooperative games were more compelling during the pandemic in attempts to preserve family peace in a time where people were confined in the home for prolonged periods of time.

```{r}
#filter by top 10 ish games for comments (run several filters here)
gloomhaven_comments <-bgg_19 %>% 
  filter(name == "Gloomhaven" & rating == 10) %>%
  drop_na(comment) %>% 
  head(10)
#themes: best "dungeon crawler," interesting, legacy games, co-op, replay value
pandemic_comments <- bgg_19 %>% 
  filter(name == "Pandemic" & rating == 10) %>%
  drop_na(comment) %>% 
  head(10)
#themes: co-op, faster to learn than other co-op games like LotR, pacing, accessible for kids and non-gamers
brassbirmingham_comments <- bgg_19 %>% 
  filter(ID == 224517 & rating == 10) %>% 
  drop_na(comment) %>% 
  head(10)
#themes: strategic, elegant, art style, high intensity
terraformingmars_comments <- bgg_19 %>% 
  filter(ID == 167791 & rating ==10) %>% 
  drop_na(comment) %>% 
  head(10)
#themes: can play solo or with people, great map, cohesive rules, streamlined play, strategic
twilightimperium_comments <- bgg_19 %>% 
  filter(ID == 233078 & rating ==10) %>% 
  drop_na(comment) %>% 
  head(10)
#themes: "You wanna space game? This is that space game!!!", improved edition, space is really cool
```

We then switched out attention from the games themselves to the individuals playing said games and leaving reviews. We filtered all users and found the average rating they gave certain games to determine if certain users were prone to more positive or negative reviews. We also counted how many reviews each specific user gave. The average rating by all of the users who left 100 or more reviews was 10. This reality shows that these users are actually giving thought to the ratings that they give, likely basing it on a set of criteria that they put together. In order to learn more, we reached out to an individual with a lot of reviews to attempt to understand their thought process. However, the user declined to comment on the subject. We thought this would shed light upon how much thought goes into each review, why reviews were given and why users feel the need to leave comments. This could even be used as a seg-way into a general story on reviews, their intentions and the thought process. 

With this set of code, we were attempting to determine the average review score left by individuals on Board Game Geek. In order to do this, we grouped each user together to further organize the data. From there, we calculated the average rating of these users and determined that the average score was 10 out of 10. This tells us that regardless of the amount of reviews individuals put in, they are most likely to give a 10. This may be due to individuals playing games, enjoying their experience, and logging on to Board Game Geek to share their pleasurable experience. 

With this set of code, we were attempting to find the top 10 reviewers, based on the total number of reviews, and determine the average rating they gave amongst their total reviews. In order to parse this information from the data, we used similar steps from the previous example. We grouped the data by specific users, then filtered to only show the top 10 reviews in descending order by the number of reviews. 

The individual with the most in the top 10 had 6471 while the indivudal with the lowest had 3992, with an average of 5187.8 reviews. Regarding ratings, the averages ranged from 5.359719 to 9.179932, averaging out to an average rating of 6.71409. This is interesting because it shows that the individuals in the top 10 must give genuine thought to their reviews, basing them on certain criteria over thousands of reviews. 

Based on the data we found, it appears that many users give a review of 10 as a default answer. This is interesting because, speaking from a personal perspective, I would be more likely to leave a negative review than a positive review. However, based on this data, individuals are likely most like to give a 10/10 review, regardless of how many reviews they leave. 


```{r}
#are users who leave positive reviews reviewing certain kinds of games? 
users_19 <- bgg_19%>%
  group_by(user) %>%
  summarise(avg_rating = mean(rating), reviews = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(reviews)) %>% 
  head(10)
```

```{r}
user_avg <- users_19 %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(avg_rating), avg_reviews =mean(reviews))
``` 
This block of code gave insight into the average rating and the average number of reviews for the top 10 review leavers. It shows how prolific they were with the amount of reviews and how seriously they took these reviews.
Analyzing this data, it became clear that there are several different interesting, engaging story ideas woven into these statistics. First, a story we would be interested in is a profile of a user leaving a prolific amount of reviews. It would be engaging for the reader to learn who such individuals are, why they are so passionate about games and reviews and how it has shaped their life. Without such stories, all reviews writers are just usernames on a screen, but that does not fill the full story. 

Secondly, this data could be used to create a trend story on the business of board games. The shifts from 2020 to 2021 could be proof of that trend, but also highlighting which games were successful and why. Clarifying these points will allow businesses to understand whats profitable and whats not, even allowing game inventors insight into what specific characteristics of certain games capativated certain audiences. 

This would become even more solid reporting through interviews with people who play games, giving added perspective to the reader.

The final story idea that comes to mind is analyzing the correlation between the pandemic, board game sales and the types of games play most during the pandemic. While assumptions about why board games became popular seem clear, it would beneficial to support these ideas with facts. In order to do so, one could analyze what aspects of certain games were so captivating and what that tells us possibly about human nature. All three of these stories idea could be very insightful, especially when sourced properly. 


Throughout this project, many ideas of stories came to us while analyzing the data. 
When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
