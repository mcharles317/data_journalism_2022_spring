This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
options(scipen=999)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
```

```{r}
allegations <- read_csv("Complaints/allegations.csv")
```
```{r}
substantiated<- allegations %>% 
 filter(rank_now =="Chiefs and other ranks" |rank_now == "Deputy Inspector" |rank_now == "Inspector") %>% 
filter(str_detect(board_disposition, "^Subst")) %>% 
group_by(first_name, last_name) %>% 
summarise(count=n())%>% 
arrange(desc(count))
```
“A dozen of those high-ranking officers have three or more complaints with substantiated allegations; 10 are white. Five have reached the rank of deputy inspector, the lowest promoted at the commissioner’s discretion; all are white.” 

Our data showed that 9 different Officers, above rank Captain, had 3 or more substantiated allegations, 7 are white.




Sentence 2: "But many of the officers also said that it’s possible to be an effective cop without so many complaints. An overwhelming majority of the city’s 36,000 officers do not have a single substantiated complaint on their records; only 1 in 9 does.” 

We concluded that 3,958 officers have received a single substantiated complaint. According to the NYPD website, the department has 36,000 officers. Based on these numbers, a discrepency of 1:9 is accurate. 

```{r}
  allegations %>% 
filter(str_detect(board_disposition, "^Subst")) %>% 
group_by(first_name, last_name) %>% 
summarise(count=n())%>% 
arrange(desc(count))
```




Sentence 3:“Eighty-six of the roughly 420 officers in the department who currently hold a rank above captain — running precincts and other large commands and overseeing hundreds of officers — have tallied at least one misconduct allegation that was substantiated by the CCRB, meaning that investigators amassed enough evidence of offenses, ranging from bad language to pistol whippings, to say that they happened and broke patrol guidelines. The most common involved improper property entries and searches.” 

We concluded that 81 officers who hold a rank above captain, have received a substantiated complaint. This is in contradiction with the data and cannot be varified with the information provided. 
```{r}
substantiated<- allegations %>% 
 filter(rank_now =="Chiefs and other ranks" |rank_now == "Deputy Inspector" |rank_now == "Inspector") %>% 
filter(str_detect(board_disposition, "^Subst")) %>% 
group_by(first_name, last_name) %>% 
summarise(count=n())%>% 
arrange(desc(count))
```
Sentence 4
"“Of at least 77 allegations made against him in 26 separate CCRB complaints, 29 were unsubstantiated; five were “unfounded,” meaning investigators concluded the incident never took place; and 27 were “exonerated,” meaning the conduct fell within patrol guidelines. Investigators have never proved that McCormack strip-searched men in the street, let alone penetrated them with his finger, though the city settled four lawsuits involving strip-search allegations against him for a total $184,500.”

We concluded that Christopher Mccormack had 27 exonerated complaints, 13 substantianed and charged comlpaints, 2 substantiated command discipline complaints and 29 unsubstantiated comlpaints. Unfounded complaints were removed from the data.
```{r}
allegations %>% 
 filter(first_name=="Christophe"& last_name=="Mccormack") %>% 
  group_by(board_disposition) %>% 
  summarise(count=n())
  

```
Sentence 5
"The investigator substantiated all 10 allegations of “abuse of authority,” including improper searches, threats of arrest and McCormack’s refusal to provide his badge number."
We concluded that McCormack did indeed have 10 allegations of abuse of authority while at the rank of Sargeant. 
```{r}
allegations %>% 
   filter(first_name == "Christophe") %>% 
filter(last_name == "Mccormack") %>% 
  filter(str_detect(board_disposition, "^Subst")) %>% 
  filter(fado_type == "Abuse of Authority") %>% 
  filter(rank_incident == "Sergeant")

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
